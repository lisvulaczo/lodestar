Communication systems are devices or networks that enable the transmission and reception of information between two or more parties. Information can be in the form of voice, data, text, image, video, or any combination of these. Communication systems can be classified into different types based on the medium, modulation, multiplexing, and coding techniques used.
 
The medium is the physical channel that carries the information from the transmitter to the receiver. It can be wired or wireless, such as copper wire, optical fiber, radio waves, microwaves, or infrared. The medium affects the speed, bandwidth, reliability, and cost of the communication system.
 
The modulation is the process of changing the characteristics of a carrier signal (such as amplitude, frequency, or phase) according to the information signal. It allows the information signal to be transmitted over the medium with less distortion and interference. The modulation can be analog or digital, such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), phase modulation (PM), or pulse code modulation (PCM).
 
The multiplexing is the process of combining multiple information signals into one composite signal for transmission over a single medium. It allows the efficient utilization of the medium and increases the capacity of the communication system. The multiplexing can be time-division multiplexing (TDM), frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), code-division multiplexing (CDM), or wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM).
 
The coding is the process of transforming the information signal into a suitable form for transmission and reception. It can provide error detection and correction, compression, encryption, and synchronization functions. The coding can be block coding, convolutional coding, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), Huffman coding, or Reed-Solomon coding.
