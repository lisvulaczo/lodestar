The film is based on a novel by Keigo Higashino, one of the most popular and acclaimed mystery writers in Japan. The novel, titled "Journey Under the Midnight Sun", was first published in 1999 and has sold over 4 million copies. It has also been adapted into a Japanese TV drama in 2006 and a Japanese film in 2011. The novel spans over 20 years and follows the lives of Yoo Mi-ho and Kim Yo-han, who are linked by a murder that occurred when they were children.
 
The Korean adaptation of the novel is faithful to the original plot and characters, but also adds some changes and twists to suit the Korean culture and audience. For example, the film changes the setting from Osaka to Seoul, and adds some scenes that show the social and political changes that happened in Korea during the 1980s and 1990s. The film also emphasizes the romance between Yoo Mi-ho and Kim Yo-han more than the novel, and gives them more depth and sympathy.
 
Into The White Night is a film that will appeal to fans of Keigo Higashino's novels, as well as fans of Korean cinema. It is a film that combines a captivating story, a stunning visual style, and a superb cast. It is a film that will make you think and feel.
