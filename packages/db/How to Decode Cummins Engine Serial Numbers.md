## Where to Find Cummins Engine Serial Numbers
  
Cummins engine serial numbers (ESN) are eight or nine digits long and consist of numbers and letters. They are unique for each engine and can be used to identify the model, year, horsepower, and other specifications of your Cummins engine.
  
The ESN is usually located on a metal tag called a dataplate that is attached to the engine block or the front cover/gear housing. The dataplate contains other information as well, such as the critical parts list (CPL), the emission statement, and the engine rating.
  
If you have lost or damaged the dataplate, you can also find the ESN on the side of the block, above the oil cooler housing, or on the rocker housing, depending on the engine model. You can refer to your ownerâs manual or visit [Diesel Parts Direct](https://www.dieselpartsdirect.com/finding-your-cummins-engine-serial-number) for a useful guide to assist in finding and interpreting Cummins engine data plates and on block serial numbers[^1^].

Once you have found your ESN, you can use it to look up genuine Cummins parts lists for your engine or original equipment (OE or OEM) by visiting [parts.cummins.com](https://parts.cummins.com).
